# SCXcore-kits

This repository contains binary distributions for the
[SCXcore](https://github.com/Microsoft/SCXcore) repository. Only the
latest version of SCX should be checked into this repository at any one
time.

This repository exists so older Linux systems can easily get binary kits
of the SCX shell bundles in an automated way. Note that older Linux systems
do not necessarily contain sufficiently new verisons of SSL to establish
secure communications with Github.
